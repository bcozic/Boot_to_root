  <title>Recover a file from the Rubbish Bin</title>
    <p>If you delete a file with the file manager, the file is normally placed into the <gui>Rubbish Bin</gui>, and should be able to be restored.</p>
    <steps>
      <title>To restore a file from the Bin:</title>
      <item><p>Open the <gui>launcher</gui> and then click the <app>Rubbish Bin</app> shortcut which is located at the bottom of the launcher.</p></item>
        <item><p>If your deleted file is there, right-click on it and select <gui> Restore</gui>. It will be restored to the folder from which it was deleted.</p></item>
    </steps>

  <p>If you deleted the file by pressing <keyseq><key>Shift</key><key>Delete
  </key></keyseq>, or by using the command line, the file has been permanently 
  deleted. Files that have been permanently deleted can't be recovered from the 
  <gui>Trash</gui>.</p>

  <p>There are a number of recovery tools available that are sometimes able to recover files that were permanently deleted. These tools are generally not very easy to use, however. If you accidentally permanently deleted a file, it's probably best to ask for advice on a support forum to see if you can recover it.</p>
