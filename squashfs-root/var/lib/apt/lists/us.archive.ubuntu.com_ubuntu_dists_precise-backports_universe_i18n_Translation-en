Package: apt-cacher-ng
Description-md5: b88e5e2d04c76e8d4500fb60880c7d76
Description-en: caching proxy server for software repositories
 Apt-Cacher NG is a caching proxy for downloading packages from Debian-style
 software repositories (or possibly from other types).
 .
 The main principle is that a central machine hosts the proxy for a local
 network, and clients configure their APT setup to download through it.
 Apt-Cacher NG keeps a copy of all useful data that passes through it, and when
 a similar request is made, the cached copy of the data is delivered without
 being re-downloaded.
 .
 Apt-Cacher NG has been designed from scratch as a replacement for
 apt-cacher, but with a focus on maximizing throughput with low system
 resource requirements. It can also be used as replacement for apt-proxy and
 approx with no need to modify clients' sources.list files.

Description-md5: 677f2a00e31e316c282b8bf13f2fbe19
Description-en: build log hardening check
 Perl tool which checks build logs for missing hardening
 flags. Hardening flags enable additional security features in the
 compiler to prevent e.g. stack overflows, format string
 vulnerabilities, GOT overwrites, etc. See e.g.
 <http://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals/SecurityHardeningBuildFlags>.
 .
 Because most build systems are quite complicated there are many
 places where compiler flags from the environment might be ignored.
 The parser verifies that all compiler commands use the correct
 hardening flags and thus all hardening features are correctly used.
 .
 It's designed to check build logs generated by Debian's
 dpkg-buildpackage (or tools using dpkg-buildpackage like pbuilder or
 the official buildd build logs) to help maintainers detect missing
 hardening flags in their packages.

  * sum of pairs
  * weighted sum of pairs
  * Shannon entropy
  * Shannon entropy with property groupings (Mirny and Shakhnovich 1995,
    Valdar and Thornton 2001)
  * relative entropy with property groupings (Williamson 1995)
  * von Neumann entropy (Caffrey et al 2004)
  * relative entropy (Samudrala and Wang 2006)
  * Jensen-Shannon divergence (Capra and Singh 2007)
 .
 A window-based extension that incorporates the estimated conservation of
 sequentially adjacent residues into the score for each column is also given.
 This window approach can be applied to any of the conservation scoring
 methods.
 .
 The program accepts alignments in the CLUSTAL and FASTA formats.
 .
 The sequence-specific output can be used as the conservation input for
 concavity.
 .

Package: fasttree
Description-md5: 92f3a33129721b36163994961abaa6df
Description-en: phylogenetic trees from alignments of nucleotide or protein sequences
 FastTree infers approximately-maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees from
 alignments of nucleotide or protein sequences. It handles alignments
 with up to a million of sequences in a reasonable amount of time and
 memory. For large alignments, FastTree is 100-1,000 times faster than
 PhyML 3.0 or RAxML 7.
 .
 FastTree is more accurate than PhyML 3 with default settings, and much
 more accurate than the distance-matrix methods that are traditionally
 used for large alignments. FastTree uses the Jukes-Cantor or generalized
 time-reversible (GTR) models of nucleotide evolution and the JTT
 (Jones-Taylor-Thornton 1992) model of amino acid evolution. To account
 for the varying rates of evolution across sites, FastTree uses a single
 rate for each site (the "CAT" approximation). To quickly estimate the
 reliability of each split in the tree, FastTree computes local support
 values with the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test (these are the same as PhyML 3's
 "SH-like local supports").
 .
 This package contains a single threaded version (fasttree) and a
 parallel version which uses OpenMP (fasttreMP).

Package: hedgewars
Description-md5: 9c3ca8edc97a53189e3cb27b4118a5ca
Description-en: Funny turn-based artillery game, featuring fighting Hedgehogs!
 Each player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the
 course of the game, players take turns with one of their
 hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are
 available to attack and kill the opponents' hedgehogs, thereby
 winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a
 variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by
 using particular tools such as the "Rope" or "Parachute", to
 move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited
 to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive
 thinking or moving.
 .
 A large variety of tools and weapons are available for players
 during the game: Grenade, Cluster Bomb, Bazooka, UFO, Homing Bee,
 Shotgun, Desert Eagle, Fire Punch, Baseball Bat, Dynamite, Mine,
 Rope, Pneumatic pick, Parachute. Most weapons, when used, cause
 explosions that deform the terrain, removing circular chunks.
 The landscape is an island floating on a body of water, or a
 restricted cave with water at the bottom. A hedgehog dies when
 it enters the water (either by falling off the island, or
 through a hole in the bottom of it), it is thrown off either
 side of the arena or when its health is reduced, typically from
 contact with explosions, to zero (the damage dealt to the
 attacked hedgehog or hedgehogs after a player's or CPU turn is
 shown only when all movement on the battlefield has ceased).

 It does that by adding their names to the folder's '.hidden' file, which
 Nautilus reads to hide the listed files the next time you open or refresh the
 folder.

Description-en: JavaScript's functional programming helper library - NodeJS
 Underscore is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides a lot
 of the functional programming support that you would expect in
 Prototype.js (or Ruby), but without extending any of the built-in
 JavaScript objects.  It's the tie to go along with jQuery's tux.
 .
 Underscore provides 60-odd functions that support both the usual
 functional suspects: map, select, invoke - as well as more specialized
 helpers: function binding, javascript templating, deep equality
 testing, and so on.  It delegates to built-in functions, if present, so
 modern browsers will use the native implementations of forEach, map,
 reduce, filter, every, some and indexOf.
 .
 This package contains the NodeJS module.

 GNU Parallel is a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel using one
 or more machines. A job is typically a single command or a small
 script that has to be run for each of the lines in the input. The
 typical input is a list of files, a list of hosts, a list of users, or
 a list of tables.
 .
 If you use xargs today you will find GNU Parallel very easy to use. If
 you write loops in shell, you will find GNU Parallel may be able to
 replace most of the loops and make them run faster by running jobs in
 parallel. If you use ppss or pexec you will find GNU Parallel will
 often make the command easier to read.
 .
 GNU Parallel also makes sure output from the commands is the same
 output as you would get had you run the commands sequentially. This
 makes it possible to use output from GNU Parallel as input for other
 programs.
